The impact of atrial fibrillation on the risk of stroke with increasing age was examined in 5184 men and women in the Framingham Heart Study. After 30 years of follow-up, chronic atrial fibrillation appeared in 303 persons. Age-specific incidence rates steadily increased from 0.2 per 1000 for ages 30 to 39 years to 39.0 per 1000 for ages 80 to 89 years. The proportion of strokes associated with this arrhythmia was 14.7\\%, 68 of the total 462 initial strokes, increasing steadily with age from 6.7\\% for ages 50 to 59 years to 36.2\\% for ages 80 to 89 years. In contrast to the impact of cardiac failure, coronary heart disease, and hypertension, which declined with age, atrial fibrillation was a significant contributor to stroke at all ages.(Arch Intern Med 1987;147:1561-1564)}",

Disease prevalence is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide, and is associated with often catastrophic and costly consequences, including heart failure, syncope, dementia, and stroke. Therapies including anticoagulants, anti-arrhythmic medications, devices, and non-pharmacologic procedures in the last 30 years have improved patients' functionality with the disease.

abstract = {Summary Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasing public health problem, often described as the epidemic of the new millennium. The rising health economic impact of AF, its association with poor quality of life and independent probability of increased mortality, has recently been highlighted. Although population ageing is regarded as an important contributor to this epidemic, obesity and its associated cardiometabolic comorbidities may represent the principal driving factor behind the current and projected AF epidemic. Obesity-related risk factors, such as hypertension, vascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea and pericardial fat, are thought to result in atrial electro-structural dysfunction. In addition, insulin resistance, its associated abnormalities in nutrient utilization and intermediary metabolic by-products are associated with structural and functional abnormalities, ultimately promoting AF. Recent elucidation of molecular pathways, including those responsible for atrial fibrosis, have provided mechanistic insights and the potential for targeted pharmacotherapy. In this article, we review the evidence for an obesity-related atrial electromechanical dysfunction, the mechanisms behind this and its impact on AF therapeutic outcomes. In light of the recently described mechanisms, we illustrate proposed management approaches and avenues for further investigations.},

abstract={The cardiovascular effects of alcohol are well known. However, most research has focused on the beneficial effects (the "French paradox") of moderate consumption or the harmful consequences, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, associated with heavy consumption over an extended period. An association between the ingestion of acute alcohol and onset of cardiac arrhythmias was first reported in the early 70's. In 1978, Philip Ettinger described "Holiday heart syndrome" (HHS) for the first time, as the occurrence, in healthy people without heart disease known to cause arrhythmia, of an acute cardiac rhythm disturbance, most frequently atrial fibrillation, after binge drinking. The name is derived from the fact that episodes were initially observed more frequently after weekends or public holidays. Since the original description of HHS, 34 years have passed and new research in this field has increased the volume of knowledge related to this syndrome. Throughout this paper the authors will comprehensively review most of the available data concerning HHS and highlight the questions that remain unresolved.},

In this paper, the authors review the associations of modifiable lifestyle factors, including alcohol abuse, smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy psychological stress, with the risk for AF development. The authors also review the associations of cardiovascular risk factors that can be better managed, including obesity and overweight, high blood pressure, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and other cardiovascular diseases, with the risk for AF. The conclusion is that a high proportion of AF can be prevented by combining strategies, focusing on the high-risk population for better risk factor management, and emphasizing healthy lifestyle choices in the whole population."

documented AF; 70 offspring participants (23 women; mean age, 62 [range, 40-81]

1 parent increased the risk of offspring AF (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio
[OR], 1.85; 95\\% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-3.06; P =

supporting a genetic susceptibility to developing this dysrhythmia. Further
research into the genetic factors predisposing to AF is warranted.}",

abstract={The past 3 decades have been characterized by an exponential growth in knowledge and advances in the clinical treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). It is now known that AF genesis requires a vulnerable atrial substrate and that the formation and composition of this substrate may vary depending on comorbid conditions, genetics, sex, and other factors. Population-based studies have identified numerous factors that modify the atrial substrate and increase AF susceptibility. To date, genetic studies have reported 17 independent signals for AF at 14 genomic regions. Studies have established that advanced age, male sex, and European ancestry are prominent AF risk factors. Other modifiable risk factors include sedentary lifestyle, smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and elevated blood pressure predispose to AF, and each factor has been shown to induce structural and electric remodeling of the atria. Both heart failure and myocardial infarction increase risk of AF and vice versa creating a feed-forward loop that increases mortality. Other cardiovascular outcomes attributed to AF, including stroke and thromboembolism, are well established, and epidemiology studies have championed therapeutics that mitigate these adverse outcomes. However, the role of anticoagulation for preventing dementia attributed to AF is less established. Our review is a comprehensive examination of the epidemiological data associating unmodifiable and modifiable risk factors for AF and of the pathophysiological evidence supporting the mechanistic link between each risk factor and AF genesis. Our review also critically examines the epidemiological data on clinical outcomes attributed to AF and summarizes current evidence linking each outcome with AF.},

Following QRS-T cancellation dominant frequencies (DFs) were computed and the relationship of DF to termination was scrutinized. For 57 episodes of paroxysmal AF (PAF) in 24 patients, DF ranged from 4.4 to 6.5 Hz (5.2 ± 0.4 Hz) compared to 5.8 to 7.4 Hz (6.6 ± 0.6 Hz) for sustained AF recordings. Comparison of the atrial frequency of the ultimate to the penultimate second demonstrated a drop in frequency in 51 of 57 episodes, P \\&lt; 0.00001. No comparable change was seen at longer time periods. Moments of comparably low frequency without termination were only occasionally seen in patients with PAF but not in patients with sustained AF.Conclusion Low frequency fibrillation was found to be much more likely to terminate. Frequency changes preceding spontaneous termination were abrupt, in contrast to the gradual frequency drop reported with drug-induced termination. The analysis of fibrillatory wave characteristics and their change over time might be used to target specific moments for pacing therapy in patients with AF.}",
